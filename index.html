      Embark on a wine journey so seamless you’ll forget that it’s just a visit.

    <h2>What is Wine About?</h2>

      Wine About is a premium Napa valley winery experience where you can feel the magic that lives here while cruising around in comfort and a carefree state of mind.

      A full day of extraordinary winery visits has been specially planned for you to ensure you take in and wade in the full pleasure of Napa, California.

    <h2> How does it work?</h2>

      Let us know where you want to be picked up. This can be your hotel, apartment, favorite restaurant or any other place that is convenient for you and your friends and family.

      Arrive in Napa Valley at the break of day in an iconic and world class, breathtaking winery. We ensure you move comfortably and safely to the next winery stop on our curated selection with little effort by you
      <br><br>
      Each destination has a unique atmosphere and experience, but all locations offer optional tastings and tours of the grounds that you may purchase directly at the winery.

      Some wineries that we have selected for you will require a reservation at no cost — we take care of automatically booking this for you. In the case of a winery which requires a pre-paid reservation, we will connect with you before the trip to make reservations.
      Our winery experience with you will last the entire day that you choose. Pickups are usually at 6:45am with you getting returned home by evening.

    <h2>So which wineries do I get to visit?!</h2>

      Sometimes the element of surprise is the best, but Castillo di Amoroso, V. Sattui and Inglenook are among our favorites that you’ll see.
